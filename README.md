# rice-classification-cnn
This repository contains code to train and test a CNN model to classify 5 rice varieties. In addition, it contains experiments to validate architecture choices like activation and dropouts.

How to train the model yourself:
1. Download the dataset: [google drive](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1no9iC3tBHER93pnuQyyKKcK_LBUnrD86/view?usp=sharing)
2. unzip it in the project folder
3. install requirements (pytorch, torchvision, pandas, matplotlib)
4. Open `rice-image-classification.ipynb` and run the notebook.
5. (optional) Open `rice-image-classification-expts.ipynb` and redo experiments.
